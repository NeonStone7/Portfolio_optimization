Efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for  given level of expected return.<br>
Expected return is the profit or loss an investor anticipates on an investment that has known historical rates of return.
The expected return for a portfolio containing multiple investments is the weighted average of the expected return of each of the investment.<br>
The rate of return is the net gain or loss of an investment over a specified time period, expressed as a percentage of the investment's initial cost. When calculating the rate of return, you are determining the percentage change from the beginning of the period till the end.<br>
